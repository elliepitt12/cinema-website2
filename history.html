  <h3 class="Title">The Beginning</h3>
  <p class="copy1">20th Century Fox film productions begun when Joseph Schenck and Darryl Zannuck left the United artists over a stock disagreement. They then began to merge talks with the management about the financial struggles of the company while under the president at the time called Sidney Kent.<br>
  <br>
  The manager then called Spyros Skouras at Fox West Coast Theaters helped make the company happen and they later became president of the new company. Before this the company had been struggling since William Fox who is the founder of 20th Century Fox lost control of the company in 1930.<br>
  <br>
  20th Century film productions then established a special school for training where fourteen young women such as Lynn Bari, Patricia Farr and Anne Nagel were launched on the trail of film stardom on the 6th August 1935. They then recieved a six month contract with the company after spending 18 months in the school. This included the contracts having a studio option for renewal for as long as seven years for them.</p>
